## Description
Tech News Java is a social media application built as an implementation of a Java/Spring Boot API. Users can create an account or login, create/edit/delete a post, and comment on/like the posts of other users. The API was built using Java, MySQL, Spring Boot, and Spring Data JPA. It was implemented into the frontend using Thymeleaf for templating.
